1. No Blank Rows, Delete row if it has no data

2. No Blank Columns with Data columns after, Delete blank columns

3. No Columns with Data but no column type in the second Row

   - Give every used column a type in Row 2

4. Maintain column property type for the entire sheet.

   i.e. If a column is of type "Date Calibrated" do not change the
        type to "Section J" halfway through the sheet. Make a new
        column of type "Section J"

5. Make First Row have some kind of title **DO NOT leave blank**

   i.e. "Calibration, Verification, Standardization Schedule"

6. Make Second Row contain all column types used in the sheet

   i.e. "Pipettor | Serial Number | Date Calibrated | Next Due | ... |"

7. **IMPORTANT** Date Type Standards:

   Current Specially recognized Date Types
       Future Dates:
     - "Next Calibration Date", "Next TMA Date", "Calibration due date",
       "Next Due"

       Past Dates:
     - "Last Calibration Date", "TMA Date", "Date Calibrated"

   A) DO NOT try to use another type name than the above for past dates or
      future dates or else the manager won't recognize the column

   B) IF POSSIBLE (not necessary), pick one type for future and past and
      standardize it for every sheet.

      i.e. Pick "Next Calibration Date", "Next TMA Date" and
           "Last Calibration Date", "TMA Date"
           and Change the other types to those

8. If you need another title row, add a column of type "NOT DATA" to the
   document and make the value 1 for each title row so that the Date
   Manager can skip them. The value for "NOT DATA" column in rows with
   data should just be blank.

   i.e. Here, row 132 has a row the parser should skip because it contains
        no data, it is just a sub-title added to the worksheet

                A-H                  I        J        K
    1 |     "Title Row"         |          |      |          |
    2 |         ...             | Serial # | Date | NOT DATA |
                                
   132| "Cannon-Fenske Opaque"  |          |      |     1    |
